PyJack
TODO Items
---------------------------------------------

- Make variable buffering within the PyJack client independent of the
  Jack server's buffer size; this would enable the PyJack client to run
  jack.process with larger buffers while still working with apps which 
  require small buffers.

- May need a select call with timeout in jack.process()
  Otherwise, if the jack server shutsdown or SIGHUPS this call might
  wait forever on the socket read.

- Monitoring?
  I don't really understand how monitoring is supposed to work.
  
- Do we need sample rate events?
  Will the sample rate ever change in the middle of a process,
  or is it a fixed value like buffer size?
  
- Peak/Power monitoring
   
Contributions are welcome!
